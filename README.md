# BIFROST Virtual Experiments

**BIFROST Virtual Experiments** is a collection of simulation workflows and analysis notebooks for the simulation and datatreatment for the BIFROST neutron instrument in the puplication (Link will be inserted later). This repository contains virtual experiment setups, instrument simulations, and analysis tools used to study instrument performance, pulse shaping, and energy resolution.

The repository is intended to support reproducible research and development related to BIFROST virtual eperiment shown in the article.

## Overview

This project includes Jupyter notebooks and supporting files for:

- Monte Carlo Particle List (MCPL) generation for BIFROST instruments
- Energy resolution studies
- Pulse shaping and tuning investigations
- Instrument configuration experiments for magnon and related simulations

The contents are primarily research-oriented.

## Requirements

The repository primarily relies on Python-based scientific tooling.

Recommended environment:

- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Common scientific Python packages (e.g. `numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`)
- McStas and McStasScript

Dependencies are not currently pinned in a `requirements.txt` file and may need to be installed manually depending on the notebooks used.

It is often the case that the *KGS* libary is used. This is a personal libary of Kristine Krighaar and details on content can be found on. 
GitHub: [KGS](https://github.com/KristineKrighaar/KGS)

NOTE: A copy of the python script containning fitting routines 'fitting.py' are included in the repo.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KristineKrighaar/BIFROST_Virtual_Experiments.git
   cd BIFROST_Virtual_Experiments
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Launch Jupyter:
   ```bash
   jupyter lab
   ```

4. Navigate to the relevant directory and open a notebook to begin.

## Figures and Data

The `Figures/` directory contains generated PNG plots and visualizations generated by the notebooks. Raw simulation output files may not be included due to size considerations. Will be shared upon reasonable request.
